# ML_assignment


- Go to kaggle and select a dataset.
- Describe the data and the objective and build candidate models using 3-5 algorithms
- Compare the performance and pick a best performing algorithm for further tuning
- Run the final optimized/tuned model for your algorithm and report the results.
- Present all steps along with the necessary explanations as a Google Colab or jupyter notebook. You can share jupyter notebooks via GitHub. Use sklearn to implement the algorithms
